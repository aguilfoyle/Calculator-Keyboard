# Calculator Keyboard Extension

## Synopsis

This is the second version for the Calculator Keyboard Extension. 
This includes several upgrades to the keyboard including new operations 
(i.e. exponential, inverse, and pi button), new keyboard keys (i.e. enter 
and space button), and an option to have the text simultaneously input to 
the text field or input the calculation on the users whim. 

## Code Example

Here are a few images of the first version of the application and images that show off the changes
in the second version.

## Motivation

The motivation for this application was to allow users to calculate mathematical operations
within a application that uses a keyboard. I wanted a simple application with a logical and modern design 
that saved a user time by staying in an application instead of exiting and opening a separate calculator application. 

## Installation

This is an on going project. It's currently unfinished: the logic - complete; constraints for iPhone sizes - incomplete.
